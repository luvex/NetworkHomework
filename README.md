NetworkHomework
===============

This is for my Computer Network Homework.


**Homework 1**

In this Homework, I achieved both the client and server with C#.
1. The client will try to connect to the server.
2. If connected successfully, the server will ask the client send "GET UDP PORT" to the server.(TCP)
3. The user should type "GET UDP PORT" on the console (assumes that he(she) doesn't know the the number of UDP port.)
4. The server send the number of the udp port to the client.
5. The client will show 3 options: 1)GET THE SERVER TIME  2)ECHO MODE   3)EXIT THE PROGRAM
6. The server will return different messages to the client in case of different options.
7. Typically, the server can serve more than one client simultaneously.
